    <p>Segovia's introduction to the guitar was at the age of four. 
In particular, he wanted the guitar to be played and studied in all countries and universities in the world, and to pass on his love for it to future generations.</p>
    <p>Segovia's first performance was in Spain, when he was 16 years old. A few years later, he made his first professional concert in Madrid, playing transcriptions by Francisco Tárrega and some works by Bach, which he himself transcribed and arranged.</p> 
    <p>As he progressed in his career and played for ever larger audiences, Segovia found that the existing guitars were not enough to play in large concert halls, because they could not produce enough volume. This encouraged him to look for technological innovations that could improve the guitar's natural amplification, 
helping in the construction of what is now known as classical guitar, of better woods and nylon strings.</p>
    <p>Segovia had many students during his career, including some famous guitarists like Steve Hackett, John Williams, Rouland Solarese, Eliot Fisk, Oscar Ghiglia, Charlie Byrd, Christopher Parkening, Michael Lorimer, Michael Chapdelaine, Virginia Luque and Alirio Diaz. He died in Madrid, victim of a heart attack, at the age of 94, having fulfilled his desire to transform the guitar (once a gypsy dance instrument) into a concert instrument.</p>
